# Monet Style Transfer Using CycleGAN üé®

This repository contains a CycleGAN-based project to perform style transfer, transforming real-world photos into Monet-style paintings. Developed using TensorFlow, this project demonstrates the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in image-to-image translation tasks.

---

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to generate Monet-style paintings from real-world photos. By training a CycleGAN model, we achieve high-quality style transfer using a dataset containing Monet paintings and real photos.

---

## **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle competition [I'm Something of a Painter Myself](https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started). It includes:
- **Monet paintings:** 300 images
- **Real-world photos:** 7,038 images

## **Key Features**
- **Preprocessing:** Normalized datasets to [-1, 1] for stable GAN training.
- **Model Architecture:**
  - **Generators:** U-Net-based architecture with residual blocks.
  - **Discriminators:** PatchGAN architecture.
  - **Losses:** Adversarial, Cycle-Consistency, and Identity Losses.
- **Training:**
  - Mixed precision for faster training.
  - Optimized using Adam optimizers with `learning_rate=2e-4` and `beta_1=0.5`.
  - Trained for 10 epochs using TensorFlow on a GPU-enabled environment.
- **Evaluation:**
  - MiFID (Memorization-informed Fr√©chet Inception Distance) for quality assessment.
  - Visualized results showcasing real-photo to Monet-style transformations.

## **Results**

### **Sample Transformations**
| Original Photo | Monet-Style Output |
|----------------|---------------------|
| ![Photo](images/photo_sample.jpg) | ![Monet](images/monet_sample.jpg) |

### **MiFID Score**
- Achieved a MiFID score of **X.XX** (lower is better), demonstrating high-quality transformations.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Fine-tuning model hyperparameters for better output quality.
- Increasing training epochs for improved consistency.
- Experimenting with other GAN architectures like Pix2Pix for comparison.
